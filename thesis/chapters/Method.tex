REML was implemented using Pytorch for the layers and functions comprising the 
inner networks and Stablebaselines3 with its open-source implementations of deep RL 
algorithm for the meta-policy \cite{RafHilGleKanErnDor:21}. 
Stablebaselines3 was developed by researchers with the intent to 
provide reliable baselines given recent findings that deep RL results are hard to 
reproduce. The same algorithms produce different results depending on seed and 
other minor choices made in the implementation \cite{HenIslBacPinPreMeg:18}. 
In fact, these differences were found to be greater in some cases than the differences between
deep RL algorithms \cite{EngIlySanTsi:20}. Stablebaselines3 benchmarks their implementations
on common environments used in research and compares theirs to other implementations.

Computations were carried out using the Tufts University High Performance Cluster (HPC) 
with 1 P100 GPU for batch jobs running about 4 hours for the regression and 12
hours for the classification tasks.
\\\\
Data was captured using Tensorboard and Weights \& Biases (wandb) 
\cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper, wandb}.
