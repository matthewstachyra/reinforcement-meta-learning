\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\noindent Thank you to my parents for supporting me. In their own words, they don't 
care what I am working on as long as I enjoy it. Perhaps that's for the best.
\\\\
Thank you to Daniel Fuenmayor for being the first person to believe in my 
thesis. 
You indulged my ideas before they took shape, and gave me the confidence to
shape them.
\\\\
Thank you to Michael Joseph for your eternal skepticism.
